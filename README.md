Proxy Server
------------

This repository includes a proxy server to the canvas API for testing
and development. No API stubbing here, we want to know it actually
works.

1. Log into canvas, and create an API token from the user settings page,
   then paste it into `proxy-config.json`.
2. Fire up the server with `node proxy.js`

Ember Data models, adapters, and serializers to work with the
[instructure canvas][1] [api][2].
